# Mini Project
Instructions were to copy Figma design perfectly.  This is my submission to the coding assignment that was sent to me via email.
I chose to organize its CSS in `@media (min-width: 1600px)`.

See the project [here](https://noanonoa.github.io/mini-project/).

## Issues
 - The `"Learn more"` text in the footer pink button does not fit in a single line when its width is set to `96px`.  The words wrap, so I did not set a width to it. 

## Notes
 - My approach would normally be drawing wireframes and quick sketches to see how I should go about structuring HTML elements and layout.  Using Figma was great because it had taken care of all the structuring for me.  I simply drew some borders and worked my way from top to bottom while committing at every milestone.

 - I spent most of my time on checking for details and assuring that I did not miss anything.  If you find something wrong, please point it out to me.

 - I didn't know how to know how to draw the ellipses quite perfectly so I exported the images and measured its placements.

 - I ran into some trouble with the Testimonials section.  The overlay is not quite right and I believe it is affecting the drop shadow on the slides as well.  I am confident with more time I would be able to fix this.
 
 ## Closing Thoughts
 I truly appreciate giving me this chance and opportunity to show what I can do.  Thank you again for a fun coding assignment!
